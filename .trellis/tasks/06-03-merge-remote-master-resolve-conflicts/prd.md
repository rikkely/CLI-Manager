# merge-remote-master-resolve-conflicts

## Goal

Merge the latest `origin/master` into the current `feat/compact-mode-launcher` branch and resolve conflicts if any appear.

## Requirements

- Fetch and merge `origin/master` into the current branch.
- Preserve existing local/untracked Trellis task directories.
- If conflicts appear, resolve them with the smallest necessary changes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Current branch includes the latest `origin/master`.
- [ ] `git status` has no merge conflict markers or unmerged paths.
- [ ] Any conflict resolution preserves existing behavior.

## Definition of Done

- Merge completed or confirmed as already up to date.
- Conflict state checked with `git status`.
- No unrelated code changes introduced.

## Technical Approach

Run a normal Git merge from `origin/master` after confirmation. The precheck found no commit or file diff from `origin/master` to current `HEAD`, so the expected result is `Already up to date` and no conflict resolution.

## Out of Scope

- Creating commits or pushing to remotes.
- Refactoring unrelated code.
- Modifying source files unless merge conflicts require it.

## Technical Notes

- `git fetch origin master` completed successfully.
- `git log HEAD..origin/master` returned no commits.
- `git diff HEAD...origin/master` returned no changed files.
- `git merge-tree $(git merge-base HEAD origin/master) HEAD origin/master` returned no conflict output.
- Current branch: `feat/compact-mode-launcher`.
